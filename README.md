# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions cause huge financial losses worldwide. By analyzing historical transaction data, we can build models to identify suspicious activities and prevent fraud in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Handle imbalanced datasets effectively.
- Compare multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing solution.
- Provide insights through data visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data Handling: `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
  - Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
  - Machine Learning: `Scikit-learn`  

## ⚙️ Methods and Approaches
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Checked for missing values.
  - Scaled numerical features (`StandardScaler`).
  - Handled class imbalance with under-sampling and over-sampling.
  - Split the dataset (80% Train / 20% Test).

- **EDA:**
  - Visualized class distribution.
  - Explored feature relationships.
  - Detected outliers and patterns.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
